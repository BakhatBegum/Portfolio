# Portfolio

Your starting portfolio, to iterate on.

## Learning Objectives

- Customise the starting portfolio with your professional details
- Iterate on your portfolio every module
- Review your colleague's portfolio

## Requirements

At Code Your Future, we expect everyone to graduate with a unique professional portfolio. Begin building this portfolio as soon as you begin our Software Development Course. At first, your portfolio will be a simple HTML/CSS page deployed to Github Pages or Netlify. This is your MVP.

Every module, you will _iterate_ on your portfolio, adding a new project and improving your design and presentation. By the time you apply to Final Projects, your portfolio will help you show you are ready to be accepted on to a Final Projects team.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] My portfolio introduces me and my work
- [ ] The design and code is my own, not a template or tutorial
- [ ] Each project is linked to my code on Github and the deployed project
- [ ] I have published my professional contact information on my portfolio
- [ ] My Accessibility and SEO scores are 100 on Lighthouse
- [ ] My portfolio is deployed
- [ ] I have replaced this README with one that describes my own portfolio
