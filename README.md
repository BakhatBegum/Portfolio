# About Me

I am currently studying software development bootcamp at
CodeYourFuture. I am a hardworking student who is committed to
pursuing my goals in becoming a software developer and advancing my
career in tech field.

## ShowCase

Passenger-Account, Blackjack-game, Mobile-configure and
Basic-calculator are my own project that I have created during my
spare time. However there are some projects from CYF as well. In CFY
platform I have learned a whole bunch of foundational principles for
